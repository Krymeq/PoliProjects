## Game Collector

Simple React app written for the purpose of Advanced Internet Application classes simulating sortable, searchable and modifiable game list. User can sort elements (either in ascending or descending order), add new, delete or edit any record from list.

This app was bootstrapped using Create-React-App, thus any dependencies, scripts and configs are left as-is.
To install any required dependencies, run `npm install`
To launch web app server, run `npm start`.

# NotVeryCleanCode
This is a repository created for Technologies Of Software Development course, 
it is a starting point for the "Clean Code" topic exercises. 
Wouter Lagerweij is an author of the ConfirmationLetterGenerator class, 
and his tutorial will be used for the exercises.

In the repository you have an example of some not very clean code. 
Most of the classes is there only to support IDE completion and to allow project to build correctly,
but they won't actually work.

It's a maven based project, so you can open it in any java IDE. It already comes with Junit dependency, 
so you can use it for your test in place of "TestCase" class examples from the tutorial.

Assignment: 
Fork or download this repository and please go to 
[Code Cleaning: A Refactoring Example In 50 Easy Steps](https://www.lagerweij.com/2011/05/28/code-cleaning-a-refactoring-example-in-50-easy-steps) and complete the steps (you can skip step no. 7 as it is not shown in this project).

**Please make a commit after every level (sufficient, satisfactory, excellent) or with a message which steps were completed.**
**Send me a link to your repository on slack, when you complete.**

* SUFFICIENT: 1-16 (First step is already done with simple test example.)
* SATISFACTORY: 1-30
* EXCELLENT: 1-50

NOTE: If tests don't pass for you, just mock some values in existing classes - currently they do nothing.
